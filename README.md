# who-is-my-rep
A tool to help US citizens to find their elected government officials and gather data on how they act in government

The thesis here is that I have a few problems
- I don't know who my congressional representative is
- I don't know how best to contact them
- I want to be an informed voter for my representative through *data* (more than anecdotes)
- I want to gather this information easily, automatically, and continuously

If there is a solution to these problems, point me to it and lets make it easier for people to find. If there isn't, lets make it. 

My initial idea is a cli command `who-is-my-rep --zipCode [zipcode]` to return information on who the represenative is and how to contact them. Next improvement is to return data on how they have voted on congressional issues in the past, consumable in the most human-friendly way possible. Even further would be a way to subscribe to information on how my elected official votes in "real time"
- My rep and likely where we have to start to find the APIs or webscraping for information https://www.congress.gov/member/kim-schrier/S001216
